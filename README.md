My personal thought and analysis on [Zillow Prize competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/zillow-prize-1/overview) dataset.

The first stage of the competition was to predict the error in estimating the price of a house made by the Zestimate algorithm defined as: $\log error = \log (Zestimate) - \log (SalePrice)$

For a detailed analysis compile $\LaTeX$ from the `docs` folder.
